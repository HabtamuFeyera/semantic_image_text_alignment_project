# Semantic Image and Text Alignment: Automated Storyboard Synthesis for Digital Advertising

## Overview
This project aims to automate the process of transforming textual advertisement concepts and asset descriptions into visually compelling storyboards for digital advertising campaigns. The solution leverages machine learning techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, to interpret textual descriptions and generate corresponding visual assets, which are then composed into cohesive storyboards.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data, as well as annotation files.
- **models/**: Holds the code for the semantic alignment model, visual generation model, and storyboard synthesis algorithms.
- **utils/**: Includes helper functions for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and storyboard generation.
- **config.py**: Configuration file for hyperparameters and settings.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies for reproducibility.
- **README.md**: Documentation explaining the project and how to run it.
- **main.py**: Main script to run the entire pipeline, coordinating data preprocessing, model training, and storyboard generation.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/HabtamuFeyera/semantic_image_text_alignment_project.git
cd semantic_image_text_alignment_project


2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Populate the `data/raw/` folder with raw textual descriptions and visual assets.

4. Preprocess the data:
python utils/data_processing.py


5. Train the semantic alignment model and visual generation model (optional):
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb


6. Generate storyboards:
jupyter notebook notebooks/storyboard_generation.ipynb


7. View and evaluate the generated storyboards.
